# AccuknoxTest

This repository is the submission for the assessment which is part of *Accuknox*'s recruitement process for the Job role *Golang Engineer Trainee*. This repository aims towards demonstrating `eBPF` programs for the given problem statements. I have studied `eBPF` just before this assessment, so this is my first `eBPF` code, kindly provide me feedbacks or feel free to create `github issue` for improvements.

## Repository Guide

The solution of 3 problems provided in the assessment are arranged in this repository as submodules. They can be found from the links below or the folders above in source code:
- **[`Problem1`](https://github.com/SRV332003/XDP_eBPF/tree/022fafe79fb61b0f86e437a19a8af8a37ddb4699 "Problem 1 solution")** : This folder contains the solution code for Problem Statement 1, that aims towards droping all /the `TCP` packets on the given `port` provided by userspace using `eBPF`.
- **[`Problem2`](https://github.com/SRV332003/XDP_eBPF2/tree/adde0d7b52506fbd4879dd3cf863ea5fe1bec3c5 "Problem 2 solution")** : This folder contains the solution code for Problem Statement 2, that aims towards droping traffic of all the ports of a given process and allow only `TCP` packet from the given `port` provided by userspace using `eBPF`.
- **[`Problem3`](https://github.com/SRV332003/XDP_eBPF2/tree/adde0d7b52506fbd4879dd3cf863ea5fe1bec3c5 "Problem 2 solution")** : Readme file in this folder explains the solution to 3rd problem statement that asks to explain a Golang code that demonstrates concurrency concepts.

### Thanks *Accuknox* for this great opportunity, I learnt a lot from itðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥.
